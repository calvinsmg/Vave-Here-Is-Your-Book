          Your coming into my life and then just leaving like that…
You know what, whenever you fight with me or get upset,
I know how I feel 😭 but I just don’t express it.
I love you to the moon and sky 🤞💖
        </p>

        <p>
          Do you know which was the best day of my life!!????
I'll tell you: 20th Dec 2023 😭 Do you know why???
Because that day, we loved, and it was the first time
we spoke for so long 🤞 and I'm so blessed to have a partner like you 😭
You are the best, Muskan, and yeah, I love you.
Again, I love you 😭🤞💖
          again <br>
          i love u 😭🤞💖
        </p>
        <p>
          Angelin💖, do you remember when you first asked me  
          why I care so much about you, I asked you why you wanted to know?  
          You told me you appreciate honesty and genuine love.  
          That’s when I knew I never wanted to hide anything from you.  
          Since I met you, my life has changed in ways I can't even explain.  
          Now, everything I do is with you in mind—not because I have to,  
          but because you make me want to be the best version of myself.  
          I love you so much, Angelin.  
          I said this before, I’m saying it now, and I’ll always say it—  
          no one has ever loved you more than I do,  
          and no one ever will😭🤞

          To my dearest Angelin, <br>
          I’ve tried countless times to put into words what you mean to me, 
          <br>
          but somehow, they always seem to fall short. Still, here I am, 
          <br>
          hoping this letter will help me say what my heart has been holding onto for so long.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find myself constantly thinking about our future, about the memories we’ve yet to make. There’s so much I want to experience with you, so many adventures we still have ahead of us. And I can’t wait for all of it—because as long as you’re by my side, I know everything will be perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want you to know that no matter what happens, I’m always going to be here for you. Through the good days and the tough ones, through the laughter and the tears. You’re my heart, my inspiration, my everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          i love u babyyyy love u love u love u 😘</p>
          <br>
          Angelin, I love you more than words could ever express, and I’ll keep loving you more with each passing day. Thank you for being you, for letting me love you, and for loving me in return. You mean the world to me. <br>
          Forever yours, <br>

         i Love youuu so much Angie🫀
         <br>
         you are the most precious gift in my life <br>

          1 Corinthians 13:4-8 (NIV) <br>
          "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails." 

        </p>
        <p>
          Paul’s description of love in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 offers a high standard, one that is difficult for humans to achieve on their own. However, it’s also a reminder of the transformative power of love in our lives. When we strive to embody this kind of love, we become instruments of peace, healing, and unity in our relationships and communities.

In times of conflict or challenge—whether with a spouse, friend, or anyone—these verses call us to a love that is patient, kind, humble, and forgiving. It’s a love that seeks the good of others above self, that rejoices in truth, and endures through all trials.

To live this way requires constant reflection, prayer, and reliance on God, who is the ultimate source of this perfect love. When we align ourselves with God’s love, we reflect His nature in our lives and relationships, embodying the eternal truth that “love never fails.”
